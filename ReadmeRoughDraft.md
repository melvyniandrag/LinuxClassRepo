## Recommended reading/viewing:
In general there is an overabundance of reading material on the internet about Linux/Unix and, as we discussed, you sometimes don't even need to go anywhere to learn - right there in your terminal you have `--help` and `man COMMAND` to get answers about different linux tools. 

### General Linux
1. Evi Nemeth's "UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook (5th Edition)" - this is a very praised book about Linux system administration.
2. Christopher Negus - "Linux Bible" - another great book with lots of information about Linux.

### BASH and Shell Scripting.
1. Advanced Bash Scripting Guide - https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html
2. Dave Taylor and Brandon Perry - "Wicked Cool Shell Scripts 2nd Ed" - a huge collection of cool bash programs with explanations of how they work. 

### Awk, Grep, Sed.
1. Arnold Robbins & Dale Dougherty - sed & awk
2. Aho & Kernighan - The Awk Programming Language
3. The pdf I've added to this repo called "grep_awk_sed.pdf"

### A good video about BASH:
1. Derek Banas "Shell Scripting Tutorial" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwrnmQumtPw

### Git
The standard recommended git book, available online for free:
1. ProGit - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2

## Course Goal
I've planned this class around the Linux Foundation System Admin Certification guidelines. This is a list of things you need to know to pass a Linux Foundation certification exam. The pdf is in this repository as well.

## Additional Cool  Stuff
Also, we won't have time for it in this class, but there's a great tutorial online called "Beej's guide to network programming". If you like network programming in C, or plan to do it in the future, I love this tutorial, I learned a ton from it and hope we have time to take a peek at it this semester. http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/pdf/bgnet_A4.pdf

## Additional Lecture Ideas
Set up a database server? E.g. a lesson like this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15872543/access-mysql-remote-database-from-command-line . Access DB from command line, make a few sql queries.

## TODO for self:
difference between apache2 and httpd?
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/httpd.html
https://www.thegeekdiary.com/linux-os-service-httpd/
I think it's just a naming difference.
