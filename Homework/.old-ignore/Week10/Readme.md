# Homework 10

Modify the ExampleFlask2 example from class. The one that returns HTML. 
Change the HTML string inside the my_flask_app.py file by modifying the lines
that say TODO XYZ. For each of the 3 todos, visit the website:
https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html
and learn something about sed. Write a little sentence describing what you
learned in place of the TODO filler I put between the "p" tags.

## Submission guidelines

Submit:
* your my_flask_app.py file
* a screenshot of your digital ocean page showing the ip address for your server
