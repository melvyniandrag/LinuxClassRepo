# Week 08 Homework

Configure two digital ocean machines - one as a postgres server as described in sections 1-7.3 in the lecture notes. The other one configure as a client machine as described in section 7.4.

For 95% credit:
Add store and warehouse tables as your server as I did in lecture. Then, connect from your client machine and perform the inner join as I did in the video.

For 100% credit:
Add an extra Boolean Not Null column `is_gucci` to the store table. Include it in your inner join result from the client machine.

## Submit
* screenshot of your digital ocean page showing your two machines running and displaying the ip addresses.
* screenshot of a terminal session showing you a) ssh into your "laptop" b) connect to the sql server via the `psql -h ... ` command c) run the inner join described above

Submit your images under Homework/Week08/StudentSubmissions/YourName.

As always, this assignment will take time, but I've given you a video in which I did *exactly* what I'm asking you to do. Grading is 0/95/100 - either do the assignment or don't, there's really no space for partial credit in this. If the above requirements are not clear make sure to contact me or a friend for help with a reasonable amount of buffer space. Be careful to include all of the required information in your screenshots.

Due via pull request March 24th at midnight.

## Conclusion
If you do the above, you will have **conquered databases on Linux**. You'll have experimented with sqlite and postgres, compared syntax, solved a murder mystery, and done some SQL joins. Good for you, I'm proud of you.
