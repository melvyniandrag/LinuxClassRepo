# Week 05 Homework

In this assignment you will test your knowledge of adding users and modifying permissions.

## Requirements

* Add the user "melvyn" to a digital ocean machine.
* Add my ssh public key to your machine so that I can access it.
* Add a user account for yourself to your machine.
* Put a file 'modifyme.txt' in /home/yourname that I have permission to modify.

## Submission guideline
Submit a PR containing your ip address ( call the file myip.txt )

The PR must contain your file 

`Homework/Week05/StudentSubmissions/YourName\myip.txt`

I will attempt to ssh in a little after midnight on February 25th like ssh melvyn@youripaddress and I'll attempt to modify /home/yourname/modifyme.txt

If I can do this you get 100 points.

## Result
You have created a user, added a public ssh key, and changed permissions on a file correctly!
