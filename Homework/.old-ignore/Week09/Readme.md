# Homework 9

## Problem 1
Configure a machine as in the Week 9 Lecture notes and as presented in the youtube lecture. 

Then, run the following curl request and submit a screenshot of the output.

```
curl -X POST \
	-H "Content-Type: application/text" \
	-H "Content-Length: 10" \
	-d"myname=melvyn" \
	localhost:8000
```

Feel free to change the data and the Content-Length

## Problem 2

Run the two curl commands shown in the second youtube lecture as described in the "A Real World Curl Example" section of the class notes. Take a screenshot showing that you requested a one time password, and then show that you supply the password to your second curl command.

The two commands are in the lecture notes and shown in the youtube video, so I'll omit them here for fear of making a typo.
