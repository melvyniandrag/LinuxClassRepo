What I Learned:

1. I learned that git has three main states of where the files can reside in which are modified, staged and committed.

2.I learned that you can undo commits and some things that have been happening and changing in git by using the "git commit --amend" command.

3.I learned that remote repositories are actually versions of a project that are hosted on the Internet or network.
