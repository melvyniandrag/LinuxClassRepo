3 things I leanred from reading chapetrs 1 + 2

1- You can ignore files by typing
$ cat .gitignore
*.[oa] -this line tells the system to ignore any files ending with ".o" or ".a"
*~ -this tells Git to ignore all files whose names end with a tilde (~)

2-Git is an improved system of BitKeeper, which was made to be simple, faster, able to
handle large projects and strong to support non-linear development.

3-Also learned that Git has the ability to 
tag specific points in a repositoryâ€™s history
as being important, and that there are different
types of tagging like sharing, deleting, annotated,
lightweigth etc.
