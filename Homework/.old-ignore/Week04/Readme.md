# Week 04 Homework

## Problem 1
Write a bash script containing 2 types of `if statements'. I showed you three
types. If you really want to go crazy, figure out what `test' does and use that
too.

## Problem 2
Write 5 grep commands that use regular expressions. Provide a text file that
will give ONE and only one result for each regex. Make sure to use the following
patterns:

* ^
* $
* [0-9]\+
* [a-z]
* [A-Z]
* \{5,\}

I've attached a sample myGrepFile.txt and myGrepCommands.sh. When I run the
myGrepCommands.sh script, you'll see only 5 results, because each regex matches
only one line. I want you to use your creativity to do something similar.

## Problem 3 
Quickly read chapters 1 + 2 from https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/
Submit a text file with a list of 3 things you learned. This is a dense read,
don't spend too long reading. I hope you can skim it in 10 minutes and find 3
things you didn't know already! When you have time later you should finish this
book on your own, it explains git very clearly and it's amazing that the authors
made such a great book freely available.

## Submimssion Guidelines
Due February 18th by Midnight via Pull Request (PR) on the class Repo. This
means you need to fork the repo, add your code to your fork, and then make a
pull request.

Be very careful about the following, I won't accept your PR if this is wrong:

your Pull Request should contain the following files:

* LinuxClassRepo/Homework/Week04/YOURNAME/Problem1/myIfScript.sh
* LinuxClassRepo/Homework/Week04/YOURNAME/Problem2/myGrepCommands.sh
* LinuxClassRepo/Homework/Week04/YOURNAME/Problem2/myGrepFile.txt
* LinuxClassRepo/Homework/Week04/YOURNAME/Problem3/whatILearned.txt
