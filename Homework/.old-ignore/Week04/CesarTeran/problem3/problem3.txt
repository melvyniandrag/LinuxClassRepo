Git uses version control where files are being used from multiple people and allows you to work together notifying that changes are being made before saving or changing a file.  The "git clone" command lets you download the exact file that is online onto your desktop in order to upload or modify files.  I have noticed the lower and higher cases execute different commands. Therefore, one must be careful when trying to execute a command on git, you may get a different result.
