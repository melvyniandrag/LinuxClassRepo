# Week 01 Homework

In this homework you will demonstrate knowledge of bash and vim. You will submit a short document and a short video.

## Document

Write a word/google docs document. For each question I'm asking for a screenshot of your terminal output, and an explanation.

* Run `ls -latr`. Take a screenshot showing your terminal output. Explain the output. What did the `-l`, `-a`, `-t`, `-r` flags do?
* Make some directories and files. Then type `ls` to show the files and directories you created. Take a screenshot showing the various commands you had to run. Explain the commands.
* Open a file with vim, put a few lines of text in it, then save and quit vim. Then go on google or chatgpt and research the `wc` command. What do `wc`, `wc -w`, `wc -c` and `wc -l` do? Run `cat` so I can see the file contents. Then run `wc`, `wc -c`, `wc -w`, and `wc -l`. Take a screenshot showing all this output. Explain the output.
* Ask chatgpt to teach you another bash command. Run it in the terminal. Show me your output and explain it.


## Video:

Use OBS or any other screen recording software. Or have someone record you with your cellphone. In a short video:
* create a file with vim
* Enter insert mode with `i` and insert some text.
* Enter insert mode with  `shift + a` and insert some text.
* Enter insert mode with `o` and insert some text.
* Enter insert mode with `shift + o` and insert some text
* save and quit

Shouldn't be longer than 30 seconds. Just show off to me that you know these basic things about vim!

## Submit

* Your document
* Your video
